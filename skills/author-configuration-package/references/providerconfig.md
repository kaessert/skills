# The project's ProviderConfig (Phase 8)

Why every project needs one, the default manifest, the two things to confirm rather than
guess, and the credential prerequisite for the README. The skill's Phase 8 states the rule.

---

A `--scratch` project has no `examples/providerconfig.yaml`; only the *language templates* ship
one. So a scratch project builds, its tests pass, it installs on a control plane — and every
managed resource it composes sits unauthenticated, because Crossplane v2 defaults an omitted
`providerConfigRef` to `{kind: ClusterProviderConfig, name: default}` and nothing in the project
creates that object. Nothing in the workflow prompts for it, and no check verifies that the
ProviderConfig a composition implicitly depends on exists. What a missing or wrong
ProviderConfig looks like on the cluster:
`control-plane-project-charter/references/charter/v2-resources.md`.

Create it in Phase 8, matching the provider family you added in Phase 4. The default is a
`ClusterProviderConfig` named `default`, below. When the project's spec or API names another
config — a namespaced `ProviderConfig` in the XR's namespace, a non-`default` name — create
that one instead, so this example and the compositions' `providerConfigRef` name the same
object (charter §5: defaults the project may override).

```yaml
# examples/providerconfig.yaml
apiVersion: aws.m.upbound.io/v1beta1     # family group, not kms.aws.m.upbound.io
kind: ClusterProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default                          # "default", to match the v2 default ref
spec:
  credentials:
    source: Secret                       # or IRSA / WebIdentity / PodIdentity / Upbound
    secretRef:
      namespace: crossplane-system
      name: aws-creds
      key: creds
```

Two things to confirm rather than guess:

- **The apiVersion is the family group** (`aws.m.upbound.io/v1beta1`), not a service group —
  a different group shape from every other resource in the family. Confirm it from the
  generated tree, where the path is the reversed group: Go
  `.up/go/models/io/upbound/m/aws/v1beta1/clusterproviderconfig.go`; Python
  `python3 <author-composition>/scripts/probe_project.py --project <root> ClusterProviderConfig`
  → `models.io.upbound.m.aws.clusterproviderconfig` = `aws.m.upbound.io` (a `grep` for
  `Literal` in that module shows the credential `source` values, not the apiVersion).
- **`ClusterProviderConfig` (cluster-scoped) vs `ProviderConfig` (namespaced)** — use the
  cluster-scoped one named `default` unless the project's spec or API calls for per-namespace
  credentials. An E2E test creates its own (author-tests' `e2e.md` reference).

Also add the credential secret to the README's prerequisites; it is not part of the package:

```bash
kubectl -n crossplane-system create secret generic aws-creds \
  --from-file=creds="${AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE:-$HOME/.aws/credentials}"
kubectl apply -f examples/providerconfig.yaml
```
